    <h1>Delicious Seekh Kabab</h1>
    <p>
        If we go according to the etymology of the dish, the word, 'Shish' or 'Seekh' means 'sword' and 'kebab' means
        'to roast'. Legend has it that the dish originated in the open fields by the Turkish soldiers who used to take
        shelter in the jungle and hunt for wild meat.
