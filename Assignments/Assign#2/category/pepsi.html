    <h1>Pepsi Cold Drink</h1>
    <h3>
        Pepsi was first invented in 1893 as "Brad's Drink" by Caleb Bradham, who sold the drink at his drugstore in New
        Bern, North Carolina. It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, "Pepsi" because it was advertised to relieve dyspepsia
        (indigestion) and "Cola" referring to the cola flavor.
